This folder has one table for each feature. Typically, there will be no more
than a handful of such tables. Each feature should have possible values that
can be freely chosen, whatever value(s) have been chosen for other features.
(Orthogonality)

So with four features you are saying that any data you want to handle can be
described by supplying between one and four values. Each data thereby can be
represented as an object in the 4-dimansional world spanned by the four
features: a point (all four features specified), a line, a plane or a
3-dimensional block (only one feature specified). Tools are merely edges
between such objects.
